This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

Use the AWS Services to help me learn the aws services.

## CodeBuild
I've configured a buld process using code build that will help me deploy the static content to the bucket.

## TODO: AWSAudioFAQ

Plenty of new discoveries in this one, each one has been a learning experience.

TODO:

* Clean up some of the UI (Modal stuff.)
* Refactor to include an interface for the types and data generated by the python scripts.
  * This has actually solidified in the python code that gets the content and generate the mark and mp3 files.
  * Create a constant strucutre for those elements that are available.

### Now go get the rest of the content and study
